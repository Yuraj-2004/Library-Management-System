# Library-Management-System

**Overview of the Library Management System**<br>
The Library Management System is a console-based application designed to manage a library's collection of books. It offers a streamlined solution for both administrators and students to handle various tasks associated with library management. The system provides two distinct user interfaces: an admin interface and a student interface, each with its own set of functionalities.
Goal and Functionality: The primary goal of the system is to manage the inventory of books efficiently, allowing for easy addition, searching, issuing, and returning of books. The system ensures that students can access available books and that administrators can maintain the library catalog without complications.

**Key Features:**<br>
**•	Book Addition:** Admins can add new books to the library by providing essential details like title, author, number of pages, and price.<br>
**•	Book Search:** Students can search for books by title, checking their availability and issue status.<br>
**•	Listing by Author:** Admins can list all books written by a specific author, aiding in organizing and retrieving specific collections.<br>
**•	Book Count:** The total number of books in the library can be displayed.<br>
**•	Issue/Return Management:** Students can issue books, and once issued, the system marks the book as unavailable until it is returned. Similarly, they can return books they have borrowed.<br>

**Outcome:**<br>
The system ensures a smooth and structured flow for managing books, making it easier for both administrators and students to track and utilize the library's resources. The inclusion of functionalities such as issuing and returning books provides a more comprehensive solution for library management.
